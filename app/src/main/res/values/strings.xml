Smart Air helps you take care of your asthma.\n
You’ll learn the difference between your two medicines:\n
- Rescue inhaler – for quick relief when you feel symptoms.\n
- Controller inhaler – use it every day to keep your lungs calm.\n\n
Your information is private — only you and your parent can see it.\n
If your parent chooses, they can share a summary with your doctor.
    </string>

    <string name="parent_popup_message">
Smart Air helps your child track asthma symptoms, medicine use, and inhaler technique.\n
You can link all your children and view their progress in one place.\n
You control what’s shared:\n
- By default, nothing is shared with a provider.\n
- You can enable or disable sharing at any time for each data type (rescue logs, symptoms, triggers, etc.).\n
- To give a provider access, send a one-time invite code or export a report — both can be revoked anytime.
    </string>

    <string name="provider_popup_message">
Smart Air lets you view parent-approved summaries of a child’s asthma progress.\n
- You’ll see only the information the parent chooses to share, such as logs, trends, or triage reports.\n
- You have read-only access — no data can be edited or added.\n
- Parents can update or revoke your access in real time.
