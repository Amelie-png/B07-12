Smart Air helps you take care of your asthma.\n
You’ll learn the difference between your two medicines:\n
- Rescue inhaler – for quick relief when you feel symptoms.\n
- Controller inhaler – use it every day to keep your lungs calm.\n\n
Your information is private — only you and your parent can see it.\n
If your parent chooses, they can share a summary with your doctor.

Smart Air helps your child track asthma symptoms, medicine use, and inhaler technique.\n
You can link all your children and view their progress in one place.\n
You control what’s shared:\n
- By default, nothing is shared with a provider.\n
- You can enable or disable sharing at any time for each data type (rescue logs, symptoms, triggers, etc.).\n
- To give a provider access, send a one-time invite code or export a report — both can be revoked anytime.
